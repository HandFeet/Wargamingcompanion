# Wargaming Companion

Still a massive work in progress so this will currently read as a roadmap. The ultimate aim is too have a useable table top gaming companion app.

For the initial release
  1) The ability to create a new game
  2) The ability to resume an old game
  3) The ability to create players
  4) A note system
        Notes can be entered as text, pdf or a webpage link
        These can be viewed in app
        They can be assocated against the turn, player or game
