The rough structure of the code goes

    app < - - - - - - -   framework
     |                        ^
     V                        |
   usecases                  data
     |                        ^
     |                        |
     - - - - - > Domain - - - -


Items on the same line are in the same layer and are allowed dependencies in them,
A dependency can not exist on the layer below but will exist on layers above.

This is too allow flexibility in changing more dynamic areas without effecting the more static
code
